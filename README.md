*Musings about web dev*

> **Please feel free** to create a post about any software topic you want (could be related to engineering, devops, design, qa, development process, etc). Also feel free to edit this readme to add topics to consider.

### Possible Topics:
- Implement google recaptcha on different environments with instruction on how to make dev captcha work for QA (so it passes automated tests). Focus on showing the React implementation?
- Building a widget that can be inserted via `<script>` tags anywhere.
- Code splitting with webpack.
- Lazy loading. `React.lazy`?
- Consistent semantic variable/function naming. Redux/redux-saga focus?
- How to implement sockets in redux-sagas. (Event-emitters, etc).
