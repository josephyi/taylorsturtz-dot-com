## Taylor Sturtz developer portfolio and blog
*javascript junky / soccer hooligan / daddy shark*

I'm a self-taught software engineer from Irvine, CA with a background in design. I write empathetic code and build full-stack applications that people connect with directly. Regardless of the platform, solving difficult problems and building smooth user experiences is my jam.

- Code splitting with webpack.
- Lazy loading. `React.lazy`?
- Consistent semantic variable/function naming. Redux/redux-saga focus?
- How to implement sockets in redux-sagas. (Event-emitters, etc).

*Borrowed and slightly modified the code syntax theme in blog from [@gaearon](https://github.com/gaearon) (which is based on [@sdras](https://github.com/sdras)'s Night Owl theme).*
