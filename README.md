## Taylor (Sturtz) developer portfolio and blog

Hi ðŸ‘‹I'm a software dev amongst other things (runner / family man / soccer fan / music nerd). I write clean, empathetic code and build apps that users connect with directly. Regardless of the platform, **solving difficult problems and building smooth user experiences is my jam**.

*Check me out on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/tsturtz) and [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/taylorsturtz)*

### Possible Blog Topics:
- Implement google recaptcha on different environments with instruction on how to make dev captcha work for QA (so it passes automated tests). Focus on showing the React implementation?
- Building a widget that can be inserted via `<script>` tags anywhere.
- Code splitting with webpack.
- Lazy loading. `React.lazy`?
- Consistent semantic variable/function naming. Redux/redux-saga focus?
- How to implement sockets in redux-sagas. (Event-emitters, etc).
- Lookup dictionaries for cleaner code.
