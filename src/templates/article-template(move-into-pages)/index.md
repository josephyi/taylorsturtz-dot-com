## Primary header

Some content...

Here's some `inline code`

Here's a JS code snippet:
```javascript
  const yourFunc = async () => {
    // return value is assigned to const when completed.
    const response = await asyncFunc()
    console.log(response) // 'Done!'
  }
```
Here's one with 'console' syntax highlighting:
```console
  const yourFunc = async () => {
    // return value is assigned to const when completed.
    const response = await asyncFunc()
    console.log(response) // 'Done!'
  }
```
Throw in some emoji here n there ðŸŽ‰
